      <h1>Golden Temple</h1>
      <img src="images/goldentemple.jpg" alt="goldentemple"><br>
      <p>Sri Harmandir Sahib, also known as Sri Darbar Sahib or Golden Temple, (on account of its scenic beauty and
         golden coating), situated in Amritsar (Punjab), is the most sacred temple for Sikhs. This temple propagates
         Sikhism's message of tolerance and acceptance through its architecture that has incorporated symbols from
         other religions. The Sikhs all over the world, wish to visit Sri Amritsar and to pay obeisance at Sri
         Harmandir Sahib in their Ardas.</p>
      <p>Guru Arjan Sahib, the Fifth Nanak, conceived the idea of creating a central place of worship for the Sikhs and
         he himself designed the architecture of Sri Harmandir Sahib. Earlier, the plan to excavate the holy tank
         (Amritsar or Amrit Sarovar) was chalked out by Guru Amardas Sahib, the Third Nanak, but Guru Ramdas Sahib
         executed it under the supervision of Baba Budha ji. The land for the site was acquired by the earlier Guru
         Sahibs on payment or free of cost from the Zamindars (landlords) of native villages. The plan to establish
         a town settlement was also made. Therefore, the construction work on the Sarovar (the tank) and the town
         started simultaneously in 1570. The work on both the projects was completed in 1577 A.D.</p>
      <p>Guru Arjan Sahib got its foundation laid by a Muslim saint Hazrat Mian Mir ji of Lahore in December 1588.
         The construction work was supervised by Guru Arjan Sahib himself and he was assisted by the prominent Sikh
         personalities like Baba Budha ji, Bhai Gurdas ji, Bhai Sahlo ji and many other devoted Sikhs.</p>
      <p>Unlike erecting the structure on the higher level, Guru Arjan Sahib got it built on the lower level and got
         it open from all four sides. Thus, he created a symbol of new faith, Sikhism. Guru Sahib made it accessible
         to every person without any distinction based on caste, creed, sex and religion.</p>
      <p>The building work was completed by September 1604. Guru Arjan Sahib installed newly created Guru Granth Sahib
         (the holy book of the Sikhs), in Sri Harmandir Sahib and appointed Baba Budha ji as its first Granthi i.e.
         the reader of Guru Granth Sahib. After this event it attained the status of 'Ath Sath Tirath', Sikh nation's
         own Tirath.</p>
