  <h1>Taj Mahal</h1>
  <img src="images/tajmahal.jpg" alt="tajmahal"><br>
  <p>Sheer poetry in marble. Majesty and magnificence, unrivalled, the Taj Mahal is the only one of its kind across the
     world. The monumental labour of love of a great ruler for his beloved queen. The ultimate realisation of Emperor
     Shahjahan's dream. One of the wonders of the world. From 1631 A.D., it took 22 years in its making. An estimated
     20,000 people worked to complete the enchanting mausoleum, on the banks of the Yamuna. For a breathtaking
     beautiful view of the Taj Mahal, one has to see it by moonlight.</p><br>
  <h4>History</h4>
  <p>The construction of this marble masterpiece is credited to the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan who erected this mausoleum
     in memory of his beloved wife, Arjumand Bano Begum, popularly known as Mumtaz Mahal, who died in A.H. 1040
     (A.D. 1630). Her last wish to her husband was "to build a tomb in her memory such as the world had never seen
     before". Thus emperor Shah Jahan set about building this fairytale like marvel. The construction of Taj Mahal was
     started in A.D. 1632 and completed at the end of 1648 A.D. For seventeen years, twenty thousand workmen are said
     to be employed on it daily, for their accommodation a small town, named after the deceased empress-'Mumtazabad,
     now known as Taj Ganj, was built adjacent to it.</p><br>
  <p>Amanat Khan Shirazi was the calligrapher of Taj Mahal, his name occurs at the end of an inscription on one of the
     gates of the Taj. Poet Ghyasuddin had designed the verses on the tombstone, while Ismail Khan Afridi of Turkey was
     the dome maker. Muhammad Hanif was the superintendent of Masons. The designer of Taj Mahal was Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.
     The material was brought in from all over India and central Asia and it took a fleet of 1000 elephants to transport it to the site. The central dome is 187 feet high at the centre. Red sandstone was brought from Fatehpur Sikri, Jasper from Punjab, Jade and Crystal from China, Turquoise from Tibet, Lapis Lazuli and Sapphire from Sri Lanka, Coal and Cornelian from Arabia and diamonds from Panna. In all 28 kind of rare, semi precious and precious stones were used for inlay work in the Taj Mahal. The chief building material, the white marble was brought from the quarries of Makrana, in district Nagaur,
     Rajasthan.</p>
