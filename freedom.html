  <h1>Freedom Struggle</h1>
  <p>In ancient times, people from all over the world were keen to come to India. The Persians followed by the Iranians
     and Parsis immigrated to India. Then came the Moghuls and they too settled down permanently in India. Chengis Khan,
     the Mongolian, invaded and looted India many times. Alexander the Great too, came to conquer India but went back
     after a battle with Porus. He-en Tsang from China came in pursuit of knowledge and to visit the ancient Indian
     universities of Nalanda and Takshila. Columbus wanted to come to India, but instead landed on the shores of
     America. Vasco da Gama from Portugal came to trade his country's goods in return for Indian spices. The French
     came and established their colonies in India.<br><br>

     Lastly, the Britishers came and ruled over India for nearly 200 years. After the battle of Plassey in 1757, the
     British achieved political power in India. And their paramountcy was established during the tenure of Lord
     Dalhousie, who became the Governor- General in 1848. He annexed Punjab, Peshawar and the Pathan tribes in the
     north-west of India. And by 1856, the British conquest and its authority were firmly established. And while
     the British power gained its heights during the middle of the 19th century, the discontent of the local rulers,
     the peasantry, the intellectuals, common masses as also of the soldiers who became unemployed due to the
     disbanding of the armies of various states that were annexed by the British, became widespread. This soon broke
     out into a revolt which assumed the dimensions of the 1857 Mutiny.</p><hr>
     <h4>Quit India Movement</h4>
     <p>In August 1942, Gandhiji started the 'Quit India Movement' and decided to launch a mass civil disobedience
       movement 'Do or Die' call to force the British to leave India. The movement was followed, nonetheless, by
       large-scale violence directed at railway stations, telegraph offices, government buildings, and other emblems
       and institutions of colonial rule. There were widespread acts of sabotage, and the government held Gandhi
       responsible for these acts of violence, suggesting that they were a deliberate act of Congress policy.
       However, all the prominent leaders were arrested, the Congress was banned and the police and army were
       brought out to suppress the movement.</p>
       <p>Meanwhile, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, who stealthily ran away from the British detention in Calcutta,
          reached foreign lands and organized the Indian National Army (INA) to overthrow the British from India.</p>
       <p>The Second World War broke out in September of 1939 and without consulting the Indian leaders, India was
         declared a warring state (on behalf of the British) by the Governor General. Subhash Chandra Bose, with the
         help of Japan, preceded fighting the British forces and not only freed Andaman and Nicobar Islands from the
         Britishers but also entered the north-eastern border of India. But in 1945 Japan was defeated and Netaji
         proceeded from Japan through an aeroplane to a place of safety but met with an accident and it was given out
         that he died in that air-crash itself.</p><hr>
