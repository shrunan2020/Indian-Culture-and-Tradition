      <h1>Medieval History</h1>
      <p>For a period that has come to be so strongly associated with the Islamic influence and rule in India, Medieval Indian
         history went for almost three whole centuries under the so-called indigenous rulers, that included the Chalukyas,
         the Pallavas, the Pandyas, the Rashtrakutas, the Muslims rulers and finally the Mughal Empire.
         The most important dynasty to emerge in the middle of the 9th century was that of the Cholas.</p><hr>
       <h4>The Palas</h4>
       <p>Between 8th and 10th centuries A.D., a number of powerful empires dominated the eastern and northern parts of
          India. The Pala king Dharmpala, son of Gopala reigned from the late 8th century A.D. to early 9th century A.D.
          Nalanda University and Vikramashila University were founded by Dharmpala.</p><hr>
       <h4>The Rashtrakutas</h4>
       <p>This dynasty, which ruled from Karnataka, is illustrious for several reasons. They ruled the territory vaster
          than that of any other dynasty. They were great patrons of art and literature. The encouragement that several
          Rashtrakuta kings provided to education and literature is unique, and the religious tolerance exercised by
          them was exemplary.</p><hr>
       <h4>The Chola Empire of the South</h4>
       <p>It emerged in the middle of the 9th century A.D., covered a large part of Indian peninsula, as well as parts
          of Sri Lanka and the Maldives Islands.<br>
          The first important ruler to emerge from the dynasty was Rajaraja Chola I and his son and successor Rajendra
          Chola. Rajaraja carried forward the annexation policy of his father. He led armed expedition to distant lands
          of Bengal, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh.<br>
          The successors of Rajendra I, Rajadhiraj and Rajendra II were brave rulers who fought fiercely against the
          later Chalukya kings, but could not check the decline of Chola Empire. The later Chola kings were weak and
          incompetent rulers. The Chola Empire thus lingered on for another century and a half, and finally came to an
          end with the invasion of Malik Kafur in the early 14th century A.D.<hr>
