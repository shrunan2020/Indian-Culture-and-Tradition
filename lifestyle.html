  <h4>Lifestyle, Values & Beliefs</h4>
  <p>India is a diverse country, a fact that is visibly prominent in its people, culture and climate. From the eternal
     snows of the Himalayas to the cultivated peninsula of far South, from the deserts of the West to the humid deltas
     of the East, from the dry heat and cold of the Central Plateau to the cool forest foothills, Indian lifestyles
     clearly glorify the geography.</p>
  <p>The food, clothing and habits of an Indian differ in accordance to the place of origin.</p><hr>
  <h4>Culture</h4>
  <p>The Indian culture varies like its vast geography. People speak in different languages, dress differently,
    follow different religions, eat different food but are of the same temperament. So whether it is a joyous occasion
    or a moment of grief, people participate whole-heartedly, feeling the happiness or pain. A festival or a celebration
    is never constrained to a family or a home. The whole community or neighbourhood is involved in bringing liveliness
    to an occasion. Likewise, an Indian wedding is a celebration of union, not only of the bride and groom, but also of
    two families, maybe cultures or religion too! Similarly, in times of sorrow, neighbours and friends play an important
     part in easing out the grief.</p><hr>
   <h4>Science</h4>
   <p>The global image of India is that of an upcoming and progressive nation. True, India has leaped many boundaries
      in all sectors- commerce, technology and development etc in the recent past, yet she has not neglected her other
      creative genius. Wondering what it is? Well, it the alternative science that has been continuously practiced in
      India since times immemorial. Ayurveda, is a distinct form of medicine made purely of herbs and natural weeds,
      that can cure any ailment of the world. Ayurveda has also been mentioned in the Ancient Indian epics like
      Ramayana. Even today, when the western concept of medicine has reached its zenith, there are people looking for
      alternative methods of treatment for its multifarious qualities.</p>
   <p>With increasing complexities in one's lives these days, people are perpetually looking for a medium through which
      they get some peace of mind. This is where another science, that of meditation and spirituality comes into the
       scene. Meditation and Yoga are synonymous with India and Indian spirituality. Meditation is one of the most
        important components of Yoga, which is a mind-body therapy involving a series of exercises. The word 'meditation' covers many disparate practices from visualizing situations, focusing on objects or images, thinking through a complex idea, or even getting lost in a provocative book, all qualifying as meditation in the broad sense. However in Yoga, meditation generally refers to the more formal practice of focusing the mind and observing oneself in the moment. Many people from India and abroad are resorting to yoga and meditation to de-stress and rejuvenate their mind.</p>
